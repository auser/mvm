Can you also make sure to document everything that we're doing here and confirm we have a `bootstrap` method that will allow us to bootstrap a new host -- we'll also want some endpoints for the coordinator that give us a dashboard-like set of stats so we can manage it from the web.

Also can we confirm this is a production-ready setup?
